# Prosperous Universer Simulator

**Prosperous Universer Simulator** is a Python-based simulation tool for planning and modeling outposts and production chains in the online strategy game *Prosperous Universe*.  
The simulator reads building definitions, materials, and production rules, and outputs simulated production schedules and inventory outcomes.

This project allows players to model how resources flow through outposts, evaluate production efficiency, and plan long-term logistics.
